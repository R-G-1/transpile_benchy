List of circuits that appear in academic papers.

#### SABRE

"Benchmarks. The benchmarks are selected from previous work [12], [33], including quantum programs from IBMâ€™s QISKit [32], some functions from RevLib [52], and some algorithms compiled from Quipper [53] and ScaffCC [54]."

#### PAS+PAM

"Qiskit generated all of them except for the QAOA circuit, which was generated by Supermarq [39]."

#### NASSC

"Benchmarks: The benchmarks are derived from the algorithms in [39], Qiskit programs [5], QASMBench [18] and RevLib [49]."
